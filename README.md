# convective_adjustment
Motivation: The Rayleigh-Benard convection system is often used to study the atmosphere, if we change the system, what are the implications of the result for real world applications?

Project Overview: 
* We take 2D horizontally-periodic Rayleigh-Benard convection and change the boundary conditions.
* Our new system is stably stratified, we have cold on the bottom and heat on the top, this creates a heat pocket, a plume, that shoots vertically up.
* As we increase the Rayleigh number, the plume loses itâ€™s coherent structure. 
* We look at the height vs buoyancy frequency to study this more.

Main question: how can the plume influence the atmosphere very far away from itself?

Method: what will it take to make this system crash and how do we numerically solve that?

Computational aspects: created simulations with the Dedalus pseudospectral framework and this required the university supercomputer.

Numerical Analysis: experimented on how much I could increase the Rayleigh number and look out for Gibbs phenomenon
* the resolution parameters 
* number of nodes used 
* CFL parameters (i.e. time step)
